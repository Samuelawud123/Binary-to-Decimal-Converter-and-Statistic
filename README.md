# Binary to Decimal Converter and Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains Java programs developed as part of a CSC 142 (Computer Programming 1) assignment. The main functionality of these programs is to convert binary numbers into their decimal equivalents and then compute and display statistical information such as the minimum, maximum, average, and median values of the converted numbers.

## Coursework

The project includes the following features:
- Conversion of binary numbers to their decimal equivalents.
- Calculation of basic statistics (minimum, maximum, average) based on the converted decimal values.
- An extra credit feature that allows the user to format the average to a specified number of decimal places.

## Files

1. **`Calculator.java`**:
   - Converts binary numbers to decimal and calculates the minimum, maximum, and average values of the input numbers.

2. **`ExtraCredit.java`**:
   - Extends the functionality of `Calculator.java` by allowing the average to be displayed to a specified number of decimal places.

## Usage

- **Compile and Run**: Use a Java compiler to compile and run the programs. For example:
  ```bash
  javac Calculator.java
  java Calculator
